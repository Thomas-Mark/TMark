Each location is linked to a story pertaining to the life of Malcolm X. Malcolm X was an African-American human rights activist during the civil rights movement.The marked locations refer to important places during his time spent in Lansing and how it impacted his life. Some stories display instances where he was a victim of racism, and discrimination, while others describe controversial monuments built for Malcolm X based on his impact on others’ lives. Malcolm X faced many challenges that changed the outlook of his life and the way his philosophies were formed. 

# **Relevance**
This project is effective in using its technology to enhance the readers' experience. The directors made it easy to navigate, while also having in depth context to each specific location and story. There were a diverse number of writers that  contributed to the context of each story, who were knowledgeable and able to translate important information to the reader. There is also contact information at the bottom of the website to get in touch with the project directors in case of any questions or suggestions.

# **Findings**
Malcolm’s Lansing adds depth to the stories told, allowing the reader to fully understand the importance of each location and how it is related to Malcolm X. There are two tabs provided at the top of the project that let you choose either a tour based model of the locations, or a list of all the stories provided. The tours are broken up into subsections that categorize groups of locations.  This creates an effective way for viewers to understand how the locations impacted pertain to Malcolm X. For example, one tour breaks up the locations into all of the homes that Malcolm X lived while in Lansing. ![Malcolm X's House Tours](https://github.com/Thomas-Mark/TMark/blob/main/images/dh%20project%20tour%20new.PNG)

There is another tour that shows each school where Malcom X received his education. This project does a good job providing the necessary once you select your tour. It is very informative and gives in-depth story telling that displays  information However, there is a “Menu” pull down tab in the project that does not work when you click on it. This makes it more difficult to get back to the home page once you begin navigating through the project. Also, on the map of the locations the geolocation prompt does not work. For each location and story, there are corresponding images and a zoomed in location on the map that gives the reader’s a clear idea of what each place looked at and where it was located relative to the other locations. At the bottom of each specific mapped location, there is a tab that takes you to google maps and gives you directions in case you want to visit. This is a unique feature that increases the overall experience. 

Overall, this project is very informative and easy to navigate through. There is a lot to learn about the history of Malcolm X’s life as well as other harsh realities that people faced then and still do today. After reading through this project, I now know more about the history of Malcolm X and the places he interacted with that impacted the course of his life. He is an important figure in history and this project made it so you could uncover part of his life that people may not have ever heard of before.
