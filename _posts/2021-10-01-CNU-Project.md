# Introduction

For this project I decided to create a map of ThingLink that displays a story about part of my experience at CNU. Creating the map was helpful because it allowed me to tell a story, while also allowing me to reflect back on my time at CNU and realizing what locations impacted me the most. This was important because I am currently a senior and it feels like yesterday I was moving into my freshmen dorm. I often take for granted all that CNU has done for me and all of the memories I have made so far. I am usually too focused on school or sports and constantly getting caught up in the moment that I fail to take time to reflect on everything I am grateful for. For my map, I decided to pin icons of locations that I interact with on a daily basis.

# My Story

The story I decided to tell through my map is a day in the life of my Wednesday’s here on campus. Wednesday’s tend to be my most busy day and when I interact with the most locations around campus. When I was given the day off on Friday, I went around campus and captured various images, sounds, and videos of the places I interacted with. My Friday’s are similar to my Wednesdays except for a few exceptions, so I was able to capture most of my material.
	
As I began capturing my content, I began to notice I was taking a second and looking back at the different memories I had made at each location during my time thus far at CNU. Locations such as the locker room, Commons, and Luter Hall are places where there have been many relationships built as well as some challenging times.These moments have helped shape me into the person I am today. Although my days can seem to be repetitive in the sense that I am doing the same routine, I was fortunate enough to note that I am still able to have a new experience everyday, and each day is an opportunity to make the most out of my time here.

# Working with ThingLink

After collecting my content, I began pinning the locations as icons and uploading the material to Thinglink. It took me a second to figure out how to upload the material for each specific location, however once I learned it was easy from there on out. I had trouble uploading my videos at first because they were too big to upload, so I had to make an adjustment and cut down the size of each video. I decided to use numbered icons to make it easier to track my linear story. I also chose to color coordinate my icons based on what kind of interaction each location provides for me. For locations that involve athletics/fitness the icons are navy blue, locations that involve food/drink are yellow, my green icons involve academics, and the red icons display miscellaneous locations. This makes it simpler for the viewer to go through and categorize each location with my daily life.

# Conclusion

Although this map only explains a day in life here at CNU, each location has had a great influence on my life and who I am as a person. I have had many different interactions with people who I barely know as well as people who have become my close friends. This project has made me realize what makes my experience here so special, and that I must cherish my time here on campus because soon I will no longer be able to live through the experiences CNU has provided me with.
