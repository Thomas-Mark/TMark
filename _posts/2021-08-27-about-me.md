# My name is Thomas Mark 
I am a senior **Finance** major here at CNU. This course was recommneded to me by a friend and I needed another writing intensive credit to fulfill. After taking a look at the course description, I figured it would be an interesting class to take since everything has started to become digital and also in hopes of becoming a better writer.  
After graduating this year I plan on attending grad school here at CNU to receive my Masters in Financial Analysis. I think this will be a great opportunity to further my education in hopes of one day becoming a financial planner. This program will allow me to take specialized classes in this field and will help me prepare to become a CFP (Certified Financial Planner).My aspirations are always changing but I know I want to pursue a career that helps out individuals, so if I can help people attain their financial goals then I would find joy in doing so.  
On campus I am apart of the Men's Lacrosse team while also being a member of the CEE Fund. Both groups have allowed me to meet a lot of great people who have become my close friends. I had never heard of CNU before I was recruited by my coach since I am from New York. Whenever people back home ask me what college I go to they always look confused when I tell them. This past spring I volunteered at a local youth lacrosse clinic for a few weeks where I coached young kids basic skills and fundamentals in hopes of growing their interest in the sport. It was an enjoyable experience and something I would like to continue to do in the future.  
At home I have two brothers. I am the middle child so I have one older and younger. I am very close to my brothers, especially my older one since we are only a year apart. ![Brothers](TMark.github.io/repositoryname/images/brothers.html). I have a pet fish named Spike that we have had for three years now, he is a Japanese fighting fish. A lot of my life revolves around sports whether it is watching or playing with friends. I am a big Giants, Knicks, and Yankees fan. Although my teams have not had much success in recent years, I have faith they will bring a championship to New York soon. My hobbies at home include spending time on the beach and on my friends boats during the summer. Every August my family spends a week camping out in Montauk, which is at the very end of Long Island. This is one of my favorite weeks of the year as I spend time relaxing on the beach, fishing, and eating lots of seafood.
